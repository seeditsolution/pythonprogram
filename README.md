## Sorting:
Sorting is a basic building block that many other algorithms are built upon. It’s related to several exciting ideas that you’ll see throughout your programming career. Understanding how sorting algorithms in Python work behind the scenes is a fundamental step toward implementing correct and efficient algorithms that solve real-world problems.
Codes for each sorting types is present in the file ***Sorting Codes.py***

### 1.[Selection Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

### 2.[Bubble Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### 3.[Insertion Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

### 4.[Heap Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
Heapsort is a comparison based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining element.

### 5.[Radix Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.

### 6.[Shell Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every h’th element is sorted.

### 7.[Counting Sort:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort)
A sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.
