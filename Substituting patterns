	sentence1 = "It is raining outside."
	
	# replacing text 'raining' in the string 
	# variable sentence1 with 'sunny' thus 
	# passing first parameter as raining 
	# second as sunny, third as the 
	# variable name in which string is stored 
	# and printing the modified string

	# variable sentence2 with 'so' thus 
	# passing parameters at their 
	# appropriate positions and printing 
	# the modified string
